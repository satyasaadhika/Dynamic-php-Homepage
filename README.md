# PHP driven webpage
Content of different sections of the page is injected using PHP template `<?= ?>`< which is shorthand for `<?php ?>`

The data for each section comes from an associative array hardcoded in the template file

The page isn't dynamic in the sense it's not driven by data from any API or database
