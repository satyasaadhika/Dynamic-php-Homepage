# PHP driven webpage
Content of different sections of the page injected using PHP template literals `<?= ?>`< which is shorthand for `<?php ?>`

The data for each section comes from an associative array hardcoded in the template file

The page isn't dynamic in the sense it's not driven by data from an API or a database
